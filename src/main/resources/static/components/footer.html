        <h5>About Me</h5>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio site! My name is Aiden Bradwell, a recent graduate from the University of Ottawa with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Psychology. I am a British Canadian citizen with the full right to work in either location, with an active security clearance from the Canadian government.
            <br><br>
            I’m a large believer that it's all about the people you know, so feel free to reach out if you’re looking for a reliable candidate, or just seeking a new connection in the tech sector!
            <br><br>
            During my tenure with the University of Ottawa, I was fortunate to gain experience in fields including computer vision research, semiconductor firmware programming, and web-app development in a government setting. I am an adaptable programmer who takes great pride in his work. I see unexplored fields of computer science as a challenge to take, and am always ready to grow as a computer scientist!
            <br><br>
            Through my personal life I am a pub-musician, who frequently partakes in Visual and Musical Arts. I have a
            strong inclination for self-betterment through reading and exercising.<br><br>
